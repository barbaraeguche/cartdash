# cartdash 🧺
a simple and responsive grocery **crud** application with smooth animations, and a clean ui.

## features 👾
- **crud functionality:** add, edit, and delete grocery items. 
- **database integration:** uses pymongo with mongodb atlas for data storage. 
- **ui/ux:** clean and responsive interface with smooth transitions powered by framer motion. 
- **notifications:** toast notifications for user actions.
- **deployment:** frontend hosted on vercel; backend on render.

## limitations 🚨
- **ui bug:** after editing an item, it briefly shifts position before moving back to its original spot.

## what I learned 💭
- **flask & pymongo:** first experience using flask with pymongo to handle crud operations.
- **http requests:** learned to use axios for http requests & resolved challenges with axios delete, which does not accept a data parameter (used query strings instead).
- **jsonify responses:** realized all api responses must be jsonified for crud operations to work correctly.
- **inline editing:** implemented in-line editing for grocery items.
- **deployment:** successfully deploying this project. the hard part was making mongodb atlas functional, but it was worth the effort.
